# CST-221
Hello everyone, 
My name is Mark Piland and I am working on my degree for computer science. This is my assignments for CST 221 for Linux. 
My hobbies is playing video games, mostly league of legends, but I do like to also go out for nice walks and meet others.
There is a lot of things I am trying to learn from coding and I hope that this class can help me understand it alot more.
